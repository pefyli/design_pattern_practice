## Design Patterns
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.


### Singleton
A Singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance. It contains static variables that can accommodate unique and private instances of itself. It is used in scenarios when a user wants to restrict instantiation of a class to only one object.

### Factory
A Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Humble Object
The Humble Object Pattern is a design pattern to make especially unit testing easier with the goal of separating behaviors that are easy to handle (domain logic) from behaviors that are hard to handle (like external events or dependencies).
